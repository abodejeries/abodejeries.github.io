      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>Established in 2001, Australian Design Architects believe contemporary Australian architecture should capture
        the spirit and culture of our land. We believe homes should provide a refuge from the outside world and that
        workplaces should have the ability to inspire.</p>
      <h1>Materials</h1>
      <p>The buildings we create are sustainable, finely crafted in durable materials and are highly valued by our
        clients and the community, enabling them to serve with integrity for generations.</p>
      <h1>Our role </h1>
      <p>Our role is to understand you, the client, allowing you to realise your vision. We create homes that reflect
        and celebrate your personalities while nurturing you and your families. We believe contemporary Australian
        residential design, whether house or apartment, should be sophisticated and relaxed, able to delight the senses.
        It should respect its climate, sheltering from the sun in summer and from the cold in winter.</p>
      <h1>Your first encounter</h1>
      <p>When you first encounter our homes, you will be struck by their impact in the streetscape. Once inside, we
        respect the importance of creating both a public personality – formal living rooms and studies leading off
        entrances – and a private sanctuary within. Private spaces are hidden behind sliding walls that can be opened to
        bring formal and informal spaces together when entertaining.</p>
      <h1>Architecture sits</h1>
      <p>We understand that our architecture sits within a landscape that creates a sense of place, so we design urban
        solutions for urban environments. We embrace the wilderness when building in the country. We also believe that
        landscape, environment and interiors are absolutely one and must be considered as one.</p>
      <h1>Luxury sense </h1>
      <p>This holistic approach means that when you view ADA buildings from afar or walk within their gardens you feel
        uplifted. When you enter them, you experience a luxurious sense of space and light which is the architecture
        expressing itself. </p>
      <h1>Relax with us</h1>
      <p>When you relax in one of our living spaces, among your artwork and furnishings, and view the landscape beyond,
        you truly understand what we set out to achieve when we craft a home for you. </p>
